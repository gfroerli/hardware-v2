## Debugger

We use the Segger JLink debugger.

The adaper used is the
[ARM-JTAG-20-10](https://www.digikey.ch/product-detail/de/olimex-ltd/ARM-JTAG-20-10/1188-1016-ND/3471401)
by OLIMEX.

## Powering the PCB

There are 3 ways to power the PCB:

- Battery power (3.3-4.2V)
- USB (5V)
- Debug probe (5V)

To choose the power source, the jumper J7 needs to be set appropriately.

If you want to power the board through the JLink debug probe, the solder bridge
R1 on the OLIMEX adapter must be closed. Then 5V power will be [supplied on pin
7 of the connector](../datasheets/ARM-JTAG-20-10_latest-schematic.pdf).
