## Firmware Update

See chapter 3.6 in the datasheet.

### Regular

The regular firmware upgrade happens through the bootloader via UART.

### Emergency

For the emergency firmware download (device bricked) one needs to connect
PGC\_INT, PGD\_INT NRESET, power and ground.

The NRESET pin will be driven with 9V during the upgrade, so any connected
parts may need protection!
