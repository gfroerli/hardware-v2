# STM32L071

## Clock

See "Low-speed external clock generated from a crystal/ceramic resonator" in
the datasheet.

Our model only has the low-speed external clock pins. So we either use a more
precise external low speed clock or the less precise internal clocks.

## Nucleo Board (NUCLEO-L031K6)

The board we used for evaluation.
